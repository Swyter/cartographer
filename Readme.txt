  About this appl.
  ----------------
  
  Currently in early stage, this program allows to position world parties/cities
  in real-time. Originally created for the Star Wars Conquest mod <http://getconquest.net>
  
  
  Acknowledgements
  ----------------
  
  It's written in Lua <http://lua.org/> and uses LuaJit as runtime. Providing a
  great speed enhancement that equals native C/C++ code.
  
  Loads common image/texture types though a tiny lib called SOIL <http://lonesock.net/soil.html>,
  based on stb_image <http://nothings.org/> but with DDS/DXT1-3-5 support.
  
  OpenGL and GLFW FFI bindings are provided by LuJGL <https://github.com/ColonelThirtyTwo/LuJGL>
  
  That's it.
