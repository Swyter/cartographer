{
  --# 1. use \\ or / for path separators, but don't use a single \ here as that won't work. :)
  --#    also, keep in mind that you need to add a comma (,) at the end of the line.
  --# 2. this accepts absolute and relative paths. by default it points to the bundled «res» sample folder that comes with this.
  --#    so it uses a relative (./) path based on the cartographer folder that will always work no matter where you put it.
  --# TL;DR: point it to your own module system folder, and it will auto-find the final mod folder (map.txt) through it.
  --# e.g. msysparties = "C:\\Users\\Swyter\\Documents\\github\\tldmod\\ModuleSystem\\module_parties.py",
  msysparties = "./res/msys/module_parties.py",
  
  --# set to false if the extra comment at the right when saving parties bothers you, in case you're a neat freak
